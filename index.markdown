# Welcome to My Website! 

Hi! My name is Hengyi Lin. I'm a former software engineer at Amazon with a passion for building products that solve real problems. Currently pursuing an MBA at Seattle University to deepen my understanding of business strategy and market dynamics. I'm interested in opportunities to found or build innovative technology companies that create meaningful impact.

## What I Do
- **Product Strategy & Development**: I help translate technical possibilities into market-ready products, combining engineering expertise with business strategy to build solutions that users actually want
- **Technical Leadership**: I guide technical architecture and engineering decisions, drawing from my experience scaling systems at Amazon
- **Market Analysis & Validation**: I research emerging opportunities and validate product-market fit through my MBA studies and entrepreneurial exploration

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on exciting projects or discussing about future opportunities. Feel free to [reach out](/contact/)!
