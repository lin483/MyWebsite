## Who I Am

Hi! I'm Hengyi Lin. I was a software engineer with 4 years of experience in backend development. I am now transforming into a tech entrepreneur and builder. I create, launch, and scale technology products that solve real problems—at the intersection of software, AI, and business strategy.

## My Journey

### Early Days
I started my engineering journey in 2014 when I attended Purdue University. After I graduated from undergraduate in 2018, I continued pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering and graduated in 2020. 

### Professional Growth
I joined Amazon in 2020. I started building and optimizing backend infrastructure supporting large-scale, mission-critical applications. This experience honed my technical skills, exposed me to world-class engineering practices, and fueled my interest in building products with real impact.

Seeking to broaden my perspective and amplify my ability to lead and innovate, I pursued an MBA at Seattle University. This journey deepened my expertise in product management, startup strategy, and the business side of technology. It also marked a turning point—shifting my focus from engineering execution to end-to-end product creation and entrepreneurship.

### Current Focus
Today, I leverage this blend of technical depth and business acumen as a tech entrepreneur, dedicated to building and launching new products that blend cutting-edge technology with genuine user value.

## Experience Highlights

### Software Development Engineer at Amazon
*Sep 2020 -- Dec 2023*

### Software Engineer Intern at AT&T  
*Jun 2019 -- Aug 2019*

## Education & Certifications

- **Master of Business Administration (MBA)** - Seattle University, Expected 2026
- **Master of Science** in **Computer Engineering** - Purdue University, 2020

## Beyond Work

I am a big fan of J-pop and K-pop music. I am also a huge gamer and currently I'm playing Monster Hunter series and Final Fantasy XIV. 

## What Drives Me

What excites me most is the process of turning a spark of curiosity into something tangible that makes people’s lives better. I’m driven by a love for learning—whether it’s mastering a new technology, understanding user needs, or finding creative solutions to complex problems. I value empathy, collaboration, and integrity in every project I take on. Building products isn’t just about code or business models for me; it’s about creating experiences that truly help and inspire others. I find the greatest satisfaction in seeing ideas come alive, iterating alongside talented people, and knowing that what we create together can have a real, positive impact on the world.
